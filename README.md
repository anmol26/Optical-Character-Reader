# Optical-Character-Reader

The objective of this project is to develop a model similar to those used at the core of the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software often bundled with desktop document scanners. The purpose of such software is to process paper-based documents by converting printed or handwritten text into an electronic form to be save in a database. Of course, this is a difficult problem due to many variants in handwriting style and printed fonts. Even so, software users expect perfection, as errors or typos can result in embarrassing or costly mistakes in a business environment.

The objective of this project is to apply SVM to do the task of OCR. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are well suited to tackle the challenges of image that Capable of learning complex patterns without being overly sensitive to noise, they are able to recognize visual patterns with a high degree of accuracy
